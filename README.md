# Hangman

**NOTE: This code is buggy and not finished, it is very much a WIP**

A primitive hangman game built in Python3. It emcompasses an approximate 29,343 words which essentially makes up ~17.190311% of all words. I have pulled these from a censored wordlist but I am not accountable for you reading some naughty words should some have fallen through the cracks.

I created this program over the summer to help me become more proficient in python but also to use as a later benchmark to notice how my coding habits change.

My plan is to make this code more efficient and far less clunky as I expand my ability to program in Python3.

(I have only recently learnt how to code in this language - it being my first - so please excuse any poor etiquette!)

- [x] Make the game process with basic functionality.
- [x] Implement visual aid (the hangman ASCII art).
- [x] Complete the intructions page.
- [x] Remove the need for capitals.
- [x] More specific parameters for entering a character (must be single character, must be alphabetic).
- [x] Implement a visual aid for where the correctly guessed letter show it's position within the word. e.g. randWord = 'foo', guess = o, '_oo' is printed.
- [ ] Use one word list instead of three.
- [ ] When user enters an incorrect character ensure that the partial word still displays.
- [ ] Somepoint down the line rewrite using a class system.
- [ ] General code cleaning.
