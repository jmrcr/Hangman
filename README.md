# Hangman

**NOTE: This code is buggy and not finished, it is very much a WIP**

A primitive hangman game built in Python3.

I created this program over summer so that I maintain my programming knowledge.

My plan is to make this code more efficient and far less clunky as I expand my ability to program in Python3.

(I have only recently learnt how to code in this language - it being my first - so please excuse any poor etiquette!)

- [x] Make the game process with basic functionality.
- [ ] Implement visual aid (the hangman ASCII art).
- [ ] Complete the intructions page.
- [ ] Remove the need for capitals.
- [ ] Somepoint down the line rewrite using a class system.
- [ ] General code cleaning.
- [x] More specific parameters for entering a character (must be single character, must be alphabetic).
- [x] Implement a visual aid for where the correct guess letter goes in the word. e.g. randWord = 'else', guess = e, 'e___' is printed.
